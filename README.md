in this repository is the result of a project with a case, namely :
predicting churn status in a bank with the result that Gradient Boosting Classifier is the best choice in terms of accuracy, especially for complex classification problems. However, if speed of training with close accuracy is the priority, Extra Trees Classifier is a solid choice, faster and less complex than Gradient Boosting.
Determines the best number of clusters from random data points with unsupervised learning method so as to produce the best clusters from the data.
predicting real estate prices with multilayer perceptron.
classifying credit card fraud for accurate and high-performance fraud detection for financial security with multilayer perceptron.
